# OBSOLETED

This package is obsoleted by the newer and updated package at [JuliaReinforcementLearning/ArcadeLearningEnvironment.jl](https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/ArcadeLearningEnvironment.jl).  Please use the updated package instead of this one.

# ArcadeLearningEnvironment.jl

This package is a [Julia](http://julialang.org/) wrapper for the
[ArcadeLearningEnvironment](http://www.arcadelearningenvironment.org/) (ALE).

ALE is a modified emulator for the Atari 2600 that can emulate around 50 games
with additional access to game state information and in-game rewards.
This is useful for learning and benchmarking artificial intelligence agents
playing computer games.

A higher-level interface on top of this package is available thanks to Tom
Breloff, at the [AtariAlgos.jl](https://github.com/tbreloff/AtariAlgos.jl)
repository.

## Citation

If you use this package for research publications, please cite the following
paper to acknowledge the work that went into ALE.

## Installation

On Mac OS and Linux the package automatically downloads and builds version
0.5.1 of the ArcadeLearningEnvironment by issuing the following commands.

```
Pkg.clone("https://github.com/nowozin/ArcadeLearningEnvironment.jl.git")
Pkg.build("ArcadeLearningEnvironment")
```

On Windows (which I have not tried yet) you can build the `libale_c.dll` file
manually and set the `LIBALE_HOME` environment variable to the directory
containing this file.  Then, the above two commands should work as well.  Note
that this is untested and any correction or feedback is welcome.


## Example

```julia
using ArcadeLearningEnvironment

# For this example you need to obtain the Seaquest ROM file from
# https://atariage.com/system_items.html?SystemID=2600&ItemTypeID=ROM

episodes = 50

ale = ALE_new()
loadROM(ale, "SEAQUEST.BIN")

S = Array(Int, episodes)
TR = Array(Float64, episodes)
for ei = 1:episodes
    ctr = 0.0

    fc = 0
    while game_over(ale) == false
        actions = getLegalActionSet(ale)
        ctr += act(ale, actions[rand(1:length(actions))])
        fc += 1
    end
    reset_game(ale)
    println("Game $ei ended after $fc frames with total reward $(ctr).")

    S[ei] = fc
    TR[ei] = ctr
end
ALE_del(ale)
```
